            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:52666:3"/>for the Liberty I take of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing your Name to it; but ſince it is an Abridgment of the Actions of our Auguſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, I dare aſſure my ſelf that I need no Apology on that account: For what more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable thing could one offer to your Lordſhip, whoſe Zeal and Affection to his Majeſty can hardly be parallel'd?</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS Book does not need a long <hi>Preface:</hi> The Title is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to recommend its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and as to the Performance no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy would take my word for it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſubmit it to the Judgment of the Reader.</p>
            <p>The Deſign I owe to Father <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelli,</hi> Coſmographer to the Republick of <hi>Venice;</hi> but he being a Stranger, and having written upon falſe Memoirs, committed ſo many Faults, that I have received very little Aſſiſtance from his little <hi>Almanack,</hi> that was printed here in Engliſh in one ſingle Sheet, which (by the by) was worſe than the Original.</p>
            <p>Tho I have had better Memoirs, and do know many things I relate upon my own Knowledg, I dare not preſume to ſay, I have committed no Errors, but I hope they are not material, and am more
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:52666:5"/>afraid of Omiſſions than Miſtakes; but whatever they be, I ſhall endeavour to mend them in a ſecond Edition, and therefore ſhall take it kindly if any body will impart to me their Remarks and Corrections.</p>
            <p>This Book, tho very ſmall, contains not only the bare Heads of things from the Year <hi>1672.</hi> down to this time, but alſo a ſhort yet exact Account of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels and Sieges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſeveral Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Pieces at length, which being ſcatter'd in looſe Papers, I thought fit to collect in this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>I relate few Events before the Year <hi>1672.</hi> on purpoſe to avoid mentioning the Wars between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in which ſo many <hi>Worthies</hi> of both Nations periſhed, tho they were at War without being angry, that Quarrel being rather the Miniſters than the Peoples.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to do Juſtice to all Men; but if any thinks himſelf wrong'd, I deſire him to be perſwaded
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:52666:5"/>that I have had no ill Deſign, and ſhall always be ready to correct my ſelf.</p>
            <p>I have taken care to avoid that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vice of the French Writers, who never dare approach their King without a <hi>Cenſer</hi> in their Hands; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have fairly related the Actions his Majeſty has been concerned in, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſucceſsful or not, without any Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, nay without giving him the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations his Archievements require, being ſenſible that tho Heroes are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to deſerve Praiſes, yet they cannot bear them.</p>
            <p>I have taken notice of ſeveral great Events in which his Majeſty was not directly concerned, by reaſon of their being very memorable, and therefore fit to be inſerted here.</p>
            <p>The Obſervation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Roman Account</hi> will, I hope, prove very uſeful; at leaſt I am certain, that to find out thoſe Dates has coſt me a great deal of Trouble.</p>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52666:64"/>taken with the Loſs of about 50 Men. But becauſe no Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for ought I know, can pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel the Bravery of this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is thought fit to mention the manner of it. The Town of <hi>Athlone</hi> is ſituated upon the River <hi>Shannon,</hi> which divides it into two Parts. That ſituated on the left ſide of the River, in the Province of <hi>Connought,</hi> is called the Iriſh Town: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides its natural Strength, being defended on one ſide by the <hi>Shannon,</hi> and on the other by a Moraſs, it is very well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the Iriſh had ſpar'd nothing to make it as ſtrong as poſſible. The other called the <hi>Engliſh Town</hi> is in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> but its Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications were neglected, and the Engliſh took it by Storm on the <hi>20th,</hi> without any great Oppoſition.

They had Water to the Arm-pits, but however ſuch was their Bravery, that they forced the Enemy from their Intrenchments, and in leſs than an Hour made themſelves Maſters of the Town, killing above 1000 of the Enemy, and taking 300 Priſoners, with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General <hi>Maxwell</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. We loſt in all about 50 Men, beſides ſome wounded. All the Officers behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with an extraordinary Bravery. When the Iriſh ſaw our Men entering the River, they ſent an Expreſs to St. <hi>Ruth,</hi> to acquaint him with it; but he anſwered, that it was impoſſible that the Engliſh ſhould pretend to take a Town,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52666:65"/>and he ſo near with an Army to ſuccour it; but a ſecond Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs having brought Advice that our Men were already Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of ſome Intrenchments, he ſent ſeveral Batallions and Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons to relieve the Place; but ſuch was the Diligence of the Engliſh, that they had by that time lined all the Works on the ſide of <hi>Connought,</hi> and gave ſuch a Welcome to the Iriſh, that they retired in great haſte, and brought to St. <hi>Ruth</hi> the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly News of <hi>Athlone</hi> being taken in his ſight.</cell>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52666:72"/>gained an Inch of Ground: but our Ammunition being ſpent by ſo long a Fight, and ſome of the Horſe of <hi>Hanover</hi> giving ground, the French poſſeſſed themſelves of our Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where there was a moſt bloody Fight for ſome time between our Horſe and the French, the King charging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the Head of the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons; but at laſt being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd by the great Number of the Enemy, they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to retire, which they did in Confuſion and Diſorder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a River that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind our Army, in which many were drowned.

The Elector of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi> was alſo in the hotteſt of the Action, as the meaneſt Souldier. This was as bloody a Battel as any that has been fought theſe 50 Years; for the French in the Relation they printed at <hi>Liſle,</hi> own to have loſt above 16000 Men, but ſince it appears that they loſt very near 20000. As our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was not ſo numerous as the French by half, we loſt not above 9000 Men, but a great many were taken Priſoners. We loſt no Baggage nor heavy Cannon, but only ſome Field-Pieces.

It did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they were incourag'd to that villanous Action imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by the French King himſelf, but the Circumſtances are more than a Preſumption of his being privy to it, for it is not likely that <hi>Louvoys</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezieux</hi> would have framed ſuch a Project without acquainting their Maſter with it; and if the French King had not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, would he not himſelf have puniſhed the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Villains upon whom that horrid Fact was proved? <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi> writ a Letter to one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle <hi>Jure</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he deſired her to wait upon the Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheims, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys</hi>'s Brother, and to tell him

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52666:83"/>and the Prince forty, yet he was ſure he could not be forced, whereas he took his Army to be ſtronger than that of the Allies. However the Prince attacked the French with ſuch a Bravery, that after a bloody and obſtinate Fight he beat them from thoſe ſtrong Poſts. The Night prevented the End of the Action, during which the French retired towards <hi>Mons</hi> in great Confuſion, leaving a great many wounded in the Field of Battel. The next Morning the Prince deſigned to purſue them, and oblige them to fight or to raiſe the Blockade of <hi>Mons,</hi> but he was prevented by the Advice he received from the States of the Peace being ſigned between them and <hi>France</hi> on the <hi>11th</hi> Inſtant.

This was the Language of the <hi>Paris</hi> Gazetteer, and other mercenary Fellows like him;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52666:83"/>but the Men of Honour that were in the French Army did not entertain ſuch Thoughts; and any impartial Man who will but caſt his Eyes on the Conduct and Character of his Majeſty, will never ſuſpect him to have been guilty of the Charge the French laid upon him.

His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did Wonders in the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and being in the midſt of the Enemy, a French Officer was going to ſhoot him with a Piſtol, but was prevented by

The Signal being given, all the Forces advanced with an unparallel'd Intrepidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52666:92"/>The Engliſh forced their way through the Breach, and notwithſtanding the Reſiſtance of the Enemy, and the great fire they made upon our Men, they gained the top of the ſame; but finding the French ſtrongly intrenched beyond it, and the Nature of the Ground not permitting our Men to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in any Front, they were forced to retire. Count <hi>Rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> was killed upon approaching Fort <hi>Cohorn,</hi> but nevertheleſs the Bavarians lodged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Saliant Angle of the Counterſcarp, in which they maintain'd themſelves by the Aſſiſtance of my Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> who came timely to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. The Action was very hot, and a Battery which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had within their Palliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does much gauled our Men; whereupon my Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Lieutenant of <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Regiment with 30 Men to paſs the Palliſadoes, and attack that Battery, which he performed with an extraordinary Bravery, turning 7 of their Cannon againſt them, and ſecuring ſome of their Mines.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52666:92"/>the French from the Poſt they attacked, and made each a good Lodgment on the ſame, which they perfected that Night and the next Day; and in the mean time our Batteries continued to play upon <hi>Terra-nova,</hi> to make that Attack more practicable. This Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was very vigorous, and it is granted, that had the Engliſh Granadeers been timely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, they would have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Poſt of <hi>Terra-nova.</hi> The Allies had near 2000 killed and wounded, and the French near as many.</cell>

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52666:95"/>that this was no Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in particular to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſeeing his Majeſty might have detained the whole Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whereas he had contented himſelf with his Perſon: and then to ſhew him the Eſteem he had for him, he was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to offer him his Liberty if he would paſs his Word for the ſending back of the Gariſons of <hi>Deinſe</hi> and <hi>Dixmude,</hi> or return himſelf Priſoner within a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.

                     <cell>This Day paſs'd the Great Seal the French King's Edict for annulling the famous Edict of <hi>Nantz,</hi> the Obſervation of which had been ſo ſolemnly ſworn by the French King himſelf. This was the laſt Blow given to the French Proteſtant Churches, which a barbarous Perſecution of 25 Years had not been able to overcome. All the remaining Churches were razed to the Ground, the Miniſters baniſhed upon pain of the Gallies, and the reſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to Sex, Age, Quality or Services, were with an unparallel'd piece of Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity delivered up to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Prieſts and Souldiers, who burnt ſome alive, ſtuck others with Pins all over their Bodies, hang'd others in Smoak, and in ſhort uſed ſuch Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities, that Poſterity will hardly believe ſo much Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty could ever have been har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in the Hearts of Men. Many were forced to ſuccumb by thoſe violent Shocks, and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:52666:115"/>turn Papiſts; and others fled away, and are now diſperſed all over the Face of the Earth in a moſt lamentable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, worthy of the Commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Chriſtian and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Souls. The French King found himſelf in a favourable Juncture to compaſs that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Deſign: The late K. <hi>James,</hi> a Bigot to the Romiſh Church, was then upon the Engliſh Throne, and could not but be charmed with the Deſtruction of the Proteſtants. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who perhaps would have eſpouſed their Party by a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Politicks, was imbroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a War with the Turks. The Lutheran Princes look'd upon that bloody Tragedy with Indifferency; and the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the Switzers, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe Caſſel,</hi> who alone durſt expreſs ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Marks of their pitying the Misfortunes of their Brethren, were not able to cope alone with ſo powerful an Enemy as the French King; but they opened their Arms to receive thoſe who fled away, whom they relieved with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:52666:115"/>Charity. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſeemed more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned than all the reſt at the Ruine of thoſe Churches, but being not able to prevent it, he deſired the States to ſettle a Fund for the Miniſters and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers who ſhould retire into their Country, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done. He was no ſooner come to the Engliſh Throne but he invited as many of that Nation as would come, and has been a conſtant Father to them, and recommended them very often to his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I muſt do alſo the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugees Juſtice, and own that they have ſerved him very faithfully. I muſt not forget neither to take notice of the Extraordinary Kindneſs the French Proteſtants received from the Engliſh, tho in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Reign; and one may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that never ſo great a Sum of Money was raiſed upon account of Charity as was then. I had forgot almoſt to give an Inſtance of the French King's Sincerity in the Preamble of the Edict for annulling that of <hi>Nantz,</hi> wherein he tells us that his Grandfather <hi>Henry</hi> IV. had
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:52666:116"/>given only that Edict with a Deſign to reconcile the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to the Romiſh Church, and that it had been his Deſign ever ſince his coming to the Throne; from whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that when he ſwore the Obſervation of it, he made a falſe Oath, tho it would be very well for him if he had not uſed himſelf to it ſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

'Tis obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that the Papiſts could not find a Pretence to uſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as they did, and gave no other Reaſon for it but their Zeal for their Religion. One thing I'll obſerve more, that tho above 500000 Witneſſes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted the bloody Perſecutions that had been committed in <hi>France,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> and ſome other brazen Faces have had the Impudence to deny it.</cell>

I propoſe this to you, not as you are my Tenants, but as my Friends, and as you are Engliſh Men. No Man can love Fighting for its own ſake, nor find any Pleaſure in Danger; and you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine I would be very glad to ſpend the reſt of my Days in Peace, having had ſo great a ſhare in Troubles: But as I ſee all lies at ſtake, I am to chuſe whether I will be a <hi>Slave</hi> and a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or a
